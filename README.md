# Using PaaS to Accelerate Enterprise Data Science

This code is for a series of blog posts investigating the use of PaaS platforms to automate data science operations. Each post is available in the *README.md* file in their respective folder, and it provides complete instructions for running the example code on that PaaS.

## DC/OS Data Science Engine

The first PaaS we investigate is DC/OS. See [dcos/README.md](dcos/README.md).
